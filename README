This project tests if the awesome Zeroturnaround library zt-zip (https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-zip) is working on Android.

The punch line -  Yes it does *yay* :)

You need to add the following libraries to your Android project:

* commons-io-1.4.jar
* slf4j-api-1.6.3.jar
* zt-zip-1.5.jar

That's it. Now you can follow the documentation how to use the library from the project's page.

Disclaimer: The code was just a super quick hack to test the lib. Don't copy that for production ;)
